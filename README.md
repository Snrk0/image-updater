## Configuration

This application runs in the browser and communicates with a server that you start by double-clicking your executable.  
The config.json file in the `imgupd_data` folder contains the following three options:  
* `port`: The port that the server is running on (default: 3000).  
* `delay`: The delay between the asynchronous download requests in milliseconds (default: 500).  
* `dynamic`: Whether to adapt the delay and the stack size to your internet speed or not (default: true).  
* `debug`: Whether to show debugging messages in the console or not (default: false).  
* `stack`: The maximum amount of downloads that are allowed to be processed simultaneously (default: 16).  

You are free to change these settings, but be aware that too many requests at the same time can overload your connection  
to the internet and cause unexpected issues/results, like missing image data or large internet performance drops.  
The port is arbitrary and does not contribute to this.
